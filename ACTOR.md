## Why Twitch Video Downloader

Twitch serves video through adaptive HLS streaming, which means there is no direct download link when you watch a clip or browse a VOD archive. Clips can be shared with short URLs, but saving them as actual video files requires workarounds. VODs are even trickier because they are segmented into hundreds of small transport stream chunks that need to be reassembled into a single watchable file. Highlights sit in a similar position, locked behind the player with no native export button.

Twitch Video Downloader is being designed to handle all of that complexity behind a single browser button. The extension will detect when you are viewing a clip page, VOD, or highlight reel, resolve the underlying video segments, and assemble them into a standard MP4 file that downloads straight to your machine. No copying URLs into external sites, no installing FFmpeg, and no juggling terminal commands.

## Planned Features

- One-click download of Twitch clips from any public clip page
- Full VOD capture including multi-hour past broadcasts
- Highlight reel downloads from channel video archives
- Resolution selection so you can pick between available quality tiers
- Automatic assembly of segmented HLS streams into a single MP4 container
- Batch queue for downloading multiple clips or VODs in sequence
- Filename templating with channel name, date, and video title
- Cross-browser compatibility targeting Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox

## How It Will Work

1. Install the extension once it is released from the browser extension store.
2. Navigate to any Twitch channel, clip page, or video archive.
3. Open the clip, VOD, or highlight you want to save.
4. Click the extension icon or the download overlay that appears on the player.
5. Select your preferred resolution from the available quality options.
6. The extension resolves the HLS manifest and begins fetching video segments.
7. Segments are assembled into a single MP4 file inside the browser.
8. The finished file is saved to your default downloads folder.

## Expected Formats

- Input: Twitch HLS streams (segmented MPEG-TS delivered over adaptive bitrate)
- Output: MP4 (H.264 video with AAC audio in a standard container)

Exported files will be compatible with virtually every media player, video editor, and mobile device without any additional conversion step.

## Who It's For

- Viewers who want to keep personal copies of favorite stream moments
- Content creators archiving their own broadcasts before Twitch auto-deletes them
- Esports fans saving tournament highlights and clutch plays for later review
- Editors and clippers collecting source footage for compilations and montages
- Community moderators preserving VOD evidence for rule enforcement records

## Use Cases We're Building For

- Save a clutch play clip before the streamer deletes it or the channel goes offline
- Archive a full past broadcast that Twitch will automatically remove after the retention window
- Download your own stream VODs to repurpose into YouTube videos or social media cuts
- Collect highlight reels from an esports tournament for a recap video project
- Build a local library of cooking, music, or art streams for offline viewing during travel

## About Twitch

Twitch is the leading live streaming platform for gaming, esports, music, and creative content, hosting millions of creators and communities worldwide. Its clip and VOD system lets viewers revisit past broadcasts, but the platform does not offer any built-in option to download videos as local files. Twitch Video Downloader is being built to fill that gap for users who want to keep a personal, offline copy of the Twitch content they already watch and engage with through their account.
